Loving you is a bliss that I will want to have for a lifetime.

Valentine's day might be once on the calendar, but for me, every day with you is Valentine's day.

I remember how I always thought our love was a coincidence, but I've come to realize it wasn't.

Every event that led me to you was orchestrated by the universe, that's why I know that our love will not only stand the test of time but will be eternal as it has been written on the galaxies.

So today, I just want to remind you of how much I love and appreciate you.

And also renew my undying vow, to love you today more than yesterday, and less than tomorrow.

I love you, babe.

I love the mischief that rings through your laughter.

I love how you let me in when you're most vulnerable.

I love how you radiate kindness to all and sundry.

I love how you sail through life gracefully no matter the challenge.

I love how you have the wisdom of the old, the heart of a child, and the strength of youth.

There are so many things I love about you, but I think my favorite is; I love how you love me.

Happy Valentine Babe.

Can you remember how I tried lecturing you on why everything about love is a facade?

I guess you can remember all of this and more.

But what you don't know is this, for the past 1 year, I've been taking examinations on love, I've had my thousand theories assessed, and just two months ago, I got my score sheet.

I got F9

I failed babe.

But I think this is the first failure I will live to celebrate for a lifetime.

I've thought hard and long about how to reach out to you, and I've lacked the confidence to confess how I failed because I'm in love with you.

But I can't let today's Valentine's pass by without confessing my love for you.

I love you babe, and even though it took me a while to say this, I want you to know that IÂ  love you and I want a lifetime with you.

I love that you love me the way Christ loves the church.

You've been playing so many roles in my life.

You've been a Priest, a Father, a lover, and a best friend.

I love how you get down on your knees and pray to God whenever I get to the crossroads.

I love how you sit on the balcony every evening with our kids to teach them about God.

I love how you keep fulfilling your promises of giving me blissful love and a home.

I prayed for this kind of love and I'm grateful to God for granting me this love of a lifetime with you.

I realized how he also gave me you, the best gift of love and companionship.

I'm grateful to be walking through this journey of faith and love with you.

Today, I pray for more of God's grace and blessings in your life.

I pray that you keep enjoying his mercies and goodness., and that he perfect all that concerns you.

And I pray that our love will forever stand the test of time.

I love you, babe.

Let's start with the way you hug me from the doorstep to the cuddling and soft kisses all through the night.

Also, how you snoop through my weekend schedules, just to find a way to fix a relaxing spa treatment.

Even the few times you secretly got my homies to come chill with me over football matches.

And those nights you tiptoe to my study room to give me a cup of coffee.

I saw all of this babe.

And more than ever I'm so happy to call you mine.

You make love sweet and considerate.

Thank you for being my life partner and my good luck charm.

I love you babe and I'm so grateful.
